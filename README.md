## Project Description
This project builds a trading bot using Reinforcement Learning techniques with the aim of maximising profits on the financial market simulator Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE). The market simulator code can be found in [BSE](BSE.py). The repository contains code to the tabular methods tried in a discrete state space setting in the folder [discrete_setting](discrete_setting). The rest of the repository focuses on the continuous state space algorithms, with code for the Monte-Carlo and Temporal-Difference learning algorithms.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/ananyajai/dissertation.git
